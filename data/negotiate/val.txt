I want to watch a good film.  <eos> THEM: What type of films are you in the mood for?  <eos> YOU: I like dramas.  <eos> THEM: I just finished watching @134380  <eos> YOU: But no chick flicks please.

It can be classic or modern  <eos> THEM: Hm, similar to Disney movies or more on the Anime side?  <eos> YOU: Disney  <eos> THEM: Gotcha. My all time favorite is @123995, it's a classic Disney movie that everybody knows.  <eos> YOU: That one makes me cry, but it's so good.  <eos> THEM: I know, right? Great movie.

It was by Nicholas Spark, so while there were some funny moments, it really would be considered a love story. My bad, I&quot;m sorry.  <eos> YOU: did you see the movie, was it good? it sounds like it wasn't tragic or a sob love story  <eos> THEM: Yes, I did see it , it's just been a long time.

I am looking for some good drama/thriller movies.  <eos> THEM: im good yourself?  <eos> YOU: I love movies like @157231  <eos> THEM: Okay let me see....... have you seen @92914 with Hilary Swank? Also @161244 is also a good one.  <eos> YOU: @188155 is another one my favorites. Is that the movie when the guy from greys anatomy is a stalker and looks in her room? Because that is a great movie! I watched @161244 but it was a little confusing for me.  <eos> THEM: really? I thought it was pretty good. what about @98383 with Ben Affleck?  <eos> YOU: That was a good movie! It was really good  <eos> THEM: And while I'm thinking about it, @79968 with James McAvoy is an intense film. Not as intense as say, @182709 , but it's still good.  <eos> YOU: @117335 is another murder mystery movie that I love because it's sort of similar to @182709 which I love. I have seen @79968 which was good.  <eos> THEM: I've never seen @117335 . Who's in it?  <eos> YOU: Kevin Spacey is starring in it with Kate Winslet, it is about a man who is accused of murder, but he was an activist against the death penalty, but it's ironic because now he is on death row for a murder he claims he did not commit.  <eos> THEM: Oh okay. Sounds almost like @133065 with Sean Connery.  <eos> YOU: Never seen that one, but I will check that one out! Thank you for the suggestions! Have a nice day.  <eos> THEM: You're welcome.

What sort of movies are you looking for today?  <eos> YOU: I'm in the mood for a good murder mystery. Time period doesn't matter, I just want to see something good.  <eos> THEM: In that case, I would recommend @204409 with Johnny Depp and Daisy Ridley.  <eos> YOU: I haven't seen that. Is it based on the original story/film?  <eos> THEM: It is. And it's just as good. I would also recommend @142376 with Michael Fassbender.

What is @114560 about?  <eos> THEM: It's about two magicians that are competing with one another, but their feud spills into murder, and framing the other for a crime. It's very deep and emotional.  <eos> YOU: Okay. Sounds good. I'll check these out.

I hope your night is going well too.  <eos> THEM: Well @203331 is truly a classic.  <eos> YOU: Yes it is. I enjoyed the movie but it was the sort of heartbreaking enjoyment that means I'll never watch it again. I have similar feelings concerning @122685  <eos> THEM: So you would like something a bit more &quot;happy&quot;?  <eos> YOU: That would be ideal but I can watch those with tragic endings, I just only watch them once.  <eos> THEM: I don't like the sad endings either.  <eos> YOU: @117122  was complete fiction and Artax came back at the end but I still cried when I watched it.  <eos> THEM: How about @96841 ?  <eos> YOU: I have not seen that. I'll check it out.  <eos> THEM: Yes I still cry with @117122 . I do recommend @96841 especially if you like Tom Hanks movies.  <eos> YOU: Cool. I will definitely watch it.

What can I help you find today?  <eos> YOU: Any good recommendations for drama movies? I'm out of the loop when it comes to those right now  <eos> THEM: I've been a little behind on Drama, admittedly, but I think I've got a few for you. Are you into historical dramas, uplifting dramas?  <eos> YOU: Great! Umm lets go with historical dramas  <eos> THEM: If you're into war films about pragmatic duty with an uplifting ending, @111540 is really good.  <eos> YOU: I will definitely look into it. I haven't even heard of that one! Do you know any good romance movies?  <eos> THEM: I do.  Are you looking for something more recent, because my go-to for Romance is usually Shakespeare? But I can do a recent recommendation.  <eos> YOU: It doesn't matter! Have you watched the @120084 with Leonardo DiCaprio? I liked it but I swear the whole ending where she literally opened her eyes and saw him drink the poison was just crazy lol  <eos> THEM: @120084 is the reason I auditioned for Tybalt last year.  I didn't get it, but I still got a fun part.  <eos> YOU: That's awesome!  <eos> THEM: Okay, romance movies!  If you like Joss Whedon and can do another Shakespearean film (with a happy ending, I promise), look into @101813 .  <eos> YOU: I will have to look into it. Have you seen any good ones on Netflix?  <eos> THEM: The only thing I didn't like about it was that the black and white film and the costume choice made it hard to differentiate characters, but I still loved it. Okay, Netflix... I admit I've been neglecting my Netflix for a while, but I'll see what I can jog up.  <eos> YOU: Haha that's fine! If you can just think of any other it might be on there.  <eos> THEM: Groovy.  :) How does Woody Allen suit you?  Because I'm thinking @157711 .  <eos> YOU: I love him! I've seen part of that one but will have to look into it more. Thanks so much for the suggestions!  <eos> THEM: It's about a man who goes back to 1920s Paris and mingles with the artists of the time, which helps him cope with his 20th century obligations.  It also asks the question &quot;When were the good old days&quot;. Sweet!  I'm glad I could help.

What kind of movies do you like?  <eos> YOU: Horror movies, comedy, I''m really not picky.  <eos> THEM: I like comedies.  <eos> YOU: Something good!  <eos> THEM: Have you seen @141482 ? It is very clever, but also has some heart.  <eos> YOU: I actually haven't! I like movies similar to @138962  <eos> THEM: @141482 is very good, but it is different from @138962 .

<input> 1 1 1 1 1 1 </input> <dialogue> THEM: Hey  <eos> YOU: Hello!  <eos> THEM: What was the last movie you saw in the theater?  <eos> YOU: The latest Insidious by Blum House Productions. Was a real disappointment. Since nearly all their horror movies are good, most of the Insidious ones anyway.  <eos> THEM: So you like horror flicks?  <eos> YOU: That's one of the genres I like, yes. @204899 was kind of boring and fast paced I feel like. Not much happened in the movie. I had expected more.  <eos> THEM: Have you seen @204419  ?  <eos> YOU: I have no seen the newest Jigsaw, actually. Been meaning to. I am kind of waiting for my husband to come home for transit leave so we can watch it together. But then we might not have time since we're moving to Hawaii soon after he comes back home. We only have about a week to get ready. Have you seen @93083  <eos> THEM: Probably out on video now...isn't it a continuation of the @115463 I have seen it.  Better than @197589 for sure.  <eos> YOU: Yeah, still would like to wait to watch it with my husband. We usually stream it anyways. I believe it is. @197589 in my opinion was good, but certainly not better than the previous.  <eos> THEM: Anything besides horror flicks?  <eos> YOU: I do like action, fantasy, mystery, comedy as well. Oh, right! I have yet to see the new @131313 .. I forgot what it was called. @92106 !  <eos> THEM: If you like spy movies @183582 would be a good choice.  <eos> YOU: I love Dylan O Brien, honestly. Oh, so James Bond eh? I would be interested in seeing that. I just may watch it tonight.  <eos> THEM: I don't like the @92106 series because I think they advertise towards kids.  Yes, James Bond.  <eos> YOU: I don't think it's towards kids, per say. Perhaps younger audience, sure. I'm 22, young adult so it's perfect.  <eos> THEM: @177160 is the movie of the year for me. If you like action, it is worth seeing twice. Have a good night.
