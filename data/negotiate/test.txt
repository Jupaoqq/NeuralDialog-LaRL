<input> 1 1 1 1 1 1 </input> <dialogue> THEM: Hello!  How are you?  <eos> YOU: Hi, how are you? Can you recommend any horror cult classics?  <eos> THEM: Sure, I love horror films.  I think one that is often overlooked is @193742 .  Some of the dialogue is stiff, but it has a unique concept and great scares.  <eos> YOU: Oh that sounds really good! I like good scares! Anything else?  <eos> THEM: If you like something that is creepy, there is @176641 .  I think the original one is the best!  <eos> YOU: Oh I saw that! You have good taste!  <eos> THEM: If you are in the mood for something that is more playful, there's always @117333 .  It's a collection of stories so I'm sure there would be something in there you would enjoy.  <eos> YOU: No I don't like playful. Looking for something intense!  <eos> THEM: Thank you!  It sounds like you have good taste, too.  Finally, I would suggest @76012 .  Always my go-to when I want to be truly frightened.  I remember seeing the re-release several years back, being the only person in the movie theater because it was in the middle of the week when I was off, and jumping out of my skin several times because it was so freaky.  <eos> YOU: I really liked that movie though I watched it in the dark when I was young and made it through haha Thanks a lot!!  <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=1 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 1 1 1 1 1 1 </partner_input> <user> 193742 1 0 1 76012 1 1 1 176641 1 1 1 117333 1 1 0 </user>

Got anything planned?  <eos> YOU: It's raining here, so I was thinking about going to a movie or going bowling.  <eos> THEM: Sounds fun. What kind of movie?  <eos> YOU: Not sure really. Maybe a romantic comedy.  <eos> THEM: Those are always entertaining. I hear @206022 is pretty good.  <eos> YOU: @206022? The remake of the Goldie Hawn movie? It's a little too slapstick-ish for me. I like classic films like @181072 What have you seen lately that's good?  <eos> THEM: What about @186271 ? It's older so you might have to look around to find it but I enjoyed it. The most recent movie I've seen was @204870 . It's a bit vulgar and more of an action comedy but I have to say it does have a good message!  <eos> YOU: I'm kinda over super hero movies. But I'll check out @186271. Thanks for the tip.  <eos> THEM: You're welcome! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. And if you're ever looking for another great romantic comedy, I also suggest @121123 .  <eos> YOU: I loved Bradley Cooper in @147970  <eos> THEM: If you loved in in that, you'll definitely love him @121123 . His performance is superb. So is his co-star's, Jennifer Lawrence.  <eos> YOU: Have to run. Thanks again for your suggestions.  <eos> THEM: You're very welcome!

I should add that to my watchlist.  <eos> THEM: @205375 will be out in a few weeks.

I'll have to see what it is. The name treehouse makes it sound intriguing, though. Thanks for the suggestions! You have a good night!  Goodbye.  <eos> THEM: You're welcome.

What kind of movie are you looking for tonight?  <eos> YOU: Hey, you know any good horror flicks?  <eos> THEM: Sure, I love horror although I'm a fan of the older movies really.  <eos> YOU: As am I.  <eos> THEM: I love @184951 .  It was well-written and even the sequels are decent.  <eos> YOU: Yes @184951 will always be a favorite of mine.  <eos> THEM: One of the scariest movies without gore I've seen would be @131178 .  But, if you've seen it before, it would probably be ruined for a 2nd viewing. The twist makes that movie and once you know it, it can't be unknown. I like the @125431  movie.  I haven't seen the 2nd one yet.  <eos> YOU: I'm not sure if I have or not.  That sounds like @170119 once you've seen it the twist is gone. @125431 is a good one for sure.  <eos> THEM: Yes, exactly!  But, watch it if you haven't seen it. I hope this helps you?  <eos> YOU: Well sounds good I will look these movies up thank you. Good bye.  <eos> THEM: Thank you!  I hope you have a good night.

What sort of movies do you enjoy?  <eos> YOU: horrors and thrillers and mysteries i liked @180899 and @128786  <eos> THEM: Oh, that's one of my favorite genres.  Did you get a chance to see @182858 ?  <eos> YOU: I didn't!  was it good?  <eos> THEM: I think it was a little graphic, but a lot of people seemed to enjoy it.  Do you prefer horrors and thrillers with a lot of gore, or more psychological?  <eos> YOU: psychological really good question  <eos> THEM: Ah, I see.  You might enjoy @180443 ; it's on Netflix and is definitely more of a psychological type.  It's sort of like @162907 , which is older but kind of along the same lines where people are trapped and have to find a way out, usually at the demise of others.

Have you by any chance seen @155467 ?  <eos> YOU: No, I don't believe I have. That sounds like a good one, though .  I've heard of the Zodiac killer.  <eos> THEM: It is about a serial Killer and it has Robert Downey Jr and it is directed by David Fincher You will love it  <eos> YOU: Nice! I like fantasy serial killers, too, like Freddy in @77161 . Although, I should say that movie hasn't aged well.  It's more campy than scary now. It was scary back in the day, though.  <eos> THEM: I dont really know much off the top of my head about fantasy serial killers. But have you seen @180224 Its a horror movie about a killer and they have to find out who is the killer  <eos> YOU: I wonder if it is based on the Zodiac killer?  I believe that was a true killer.  <eos> THEM: Yea that movie Zodiac is based on the Zodiac Killer  <eos> YOU: I'll check it out. I also like the classics like @99244  and @130591 . Thank you for the suggestion!  <eos> THEM: Dang I have not seen many classics . But I do think you should check out @115463  <eos> YOU: I'm not a huge fan of that one unfortunately. I don't mind gore, but when I started watching that one, I just had to turn it off.  I must be getting old.  I used to not mind it.  Something about that movie. I'm definitely checking out @155467 .  It helps that I love Robert Downey Jr., too.  <eos> THEM: Yea that makes sense.

Red eye sounds very intriguing .  <eos> THEM: One of my favorites is @203424 I love anthony hopkins  <eos> YOU: Of course , that is a classic. Amazing movie , can rewatch it at any time  <eos> THEM: My favorite genre is horror, do you have any suggestions for me?  <eos> YOU: I just saw @205430 a couple days ago. Its more monster horror but it was still a nice movie to watch Sadly , I am not a huge fan of horror so I can't really help you there  <eos> THEM: I saw that, I thought it was an excellent use of silence in a horror film, especially for a first time director  <eos> YOU: Yea and it was a great thing that they casted an actual deaf girl to play the role . Makes the movie feel more real after learning that  <eos> THEM: Yes, representation is important Have you seen any good comedies lately?  <eos> YOU: No I have not , have you . I been meaning to watch some.  <eos> THEM: @204870 was hilarious, I would definitely recommend it  <eos> YOU: Oh of course that was a great movie , I personally preferred the first one tho  <eos> THEM: One of my favorites overall is @184605 .

<input> 1 1 1 1 1 1 </input> <dialogue> THEM: Hello!  <eos> YOU: Hi how are you?!  <eos> THEM: Doing fine, and you?  <eos> YOU: Good thanks for asking what kind of movies do you like ?  <eos> THEM: I tend to like things that are visually distinctive with multiple layers to work with.  I lean towards animation most of the time because of its expressiveness.  A good example would be the bleakness of @136013, an animated documentary that just throws away objectivity and tries to recreate a war moment through the eyes of its participants. What do you tend to like in films?  <eos> YOU: Hmm that’s pretty cool I will have to check that out and pay attention to it ! I like comedy and action especially @101264  <eos> THEM: Have you seen any of the Three Flavours Cornetto trilogy ( @182960, @127115, @77666 )?  They're delightful combinations of genre satire and genre tributes with tight cinematography and a delightful wit, directed by the person behind @195979 . They're quite British, but are otherwise extremely distinct and, despite not being connected in terms of story, feel like a cohesive series. (they also have running gags throughout, some of which are things brought up very early in the films and come back as a punchline you'd almost forget)  <eos> YOU: I haven’t but I will add them to my list for sure !  <eos> THEM: Any other films you like in particular?  <eos> YOU: I usually watch American films  <eos> THEM: In that case, I can just recommend the aforementioned @195979, a fun and tightly-choreographed action film packed with wit, a heist film where almost everything is in sync with the music.  <eos> YOU: Is it on Netflix ?!  <eos> THEM: I'm not sure, but I can check not at this point, unfortunately  <eos> YOU: Ahhh dang no worries I’m sure I will be able to find it somewhere even the video store !  <eos> THEM: To top things off (and fulfill my requirements), there's an anime film from a highly-regarded director that inspired many elements of @101264, @78453 by Satoshi Kon.  It's not to everyone's taste, but it might be worth a go if you want that kind of surreal head trip. Unfortunately, I'm running low on time, so I'll have to stop there.  I hope that at least some of these are appealing and that you find at least one enjoyable. Have a good evening.  <eos> YOU: No problem I really appreciate your thoughts burn :)  <eos> THEM: <selection> </dialogue> <output> item0=1 item1=1 item2=1 item0=1 item1=1 item2=1 </output> <partner_input> 1 1 1 1 1 1 </partner_input> <user> 136013 1 0 1 195979 1 0 1 127115 1 0 1 78453 1 0 2 77666 1 0 1 182960 1 0 1 101264 0 1 1 </user>

I have heard great things about that Have you seen @170768 Another solid korean action movie  <eos> THEM: @186421  is also excellent No I'll look into that for sure  <eos> YOU: Yea but I felt that movie was too melodramatic but I still enjoyed it a lot  <eos> THEM: The ending really got me  <eos> YOU: Yea I saw it coming but it was still sad to see Hated the businessman so much in that movie  <eos> THEM: Yeah I was just waiting for him to die, he lived longer than I thought he would  <eos> YOU: Well do you know any good thrillers ?

I would recommend going to see @178258 .  My friend told me it was worth the price of a ticket. And, if you like @106233 , did you ever see the most recent @83552 ?  It was funny.  Definitely a different concept.  <eos> YOU: I haven't seen it but I heard it was awesome!

<input> 1 1 1 1 1 1 </input> <dialogue> YOU: Hi.  <eos> THEM: @169419  <eos> YOU: I don't like superhero movies.  <eos> THEM: Neither do I usually, but this film has some humor to it.  <eos> YOU: Can you recommend something purely comical?  <eos> THEM: The actions scenes are a majority of the movie, but it has nice graphics. Do you like mythology? I would rate this movie an 8 out of 10.  <eos> YOU: Nope, not enough to seek it. I like to be scared and to laugh at movies.  <eos> THEM: @111918 is a seriously hilarious. it is extremely funny!  <eos> YOU: I seen part of @111918. It seemed like an alright movie.  <eos> THEM: Will Ferrell and Mark Walburgh really compliment each other. I laughed out loud throughout the whole movie.

Any other Will Ferrell movies you can suggest?  <eos> THEM: Yes, otherwise I would be wasting your time.  <eos> YOU: True.  <eos> THEM: @142910 is also worth checking out. That is actually the movie with Mark.  <eos> YOU: What's that about?  <eos> THEM: It is about two cops.  Will's character used to be a pimp. Many good laughs to be had. I hope you check them out. @124142 is good for Christmas time, but it is a bit corny. The new @83552 is way better than I thought.  <eos> YOU: I'm not interested in @142910. But have you seen @141928?  <eos> THEM: Jack Black and the Rock play the roles of the avatars in the game.  <eos> YOU: It seemed funny from the previews years back.  <eos> THEM: There is a new one that came out last year. It is much more funny than the original.  <eos> YOU: I was still referring to @141928 by the way.  <eos> THEM: @141928 was alright. @133813  is another classic he is in.  <eos> YOU: You're not as enthusiastic about @141928, are you?  <eos> THEM: I just don't like the Nascar theme much.  <eos> YOU: I am familiar @133813. It looks like it can be good. I will go with @133813. Thanks.  <eos> THEM: That sounds great enjoy it with friends.  <eos> YOU: I will.
